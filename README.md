# Blank Audio - Hours of Silence

Edited by @alekssamos
Changes:

I left only one file.
I added it in the same voice message format.
This is necessary for a Telegram bot that accepts audio_url only as Inline. You can edit it by uploading a file locally after sending.
It's a terrible crutch, but it works.

### Breathe...
### Remember...
### The sound of silence...
### Essence of all there is...
### No gap
### No separation
### Harmonious unity of the Silence...
### How it would be to go back to that space?

# Silence is golden...
